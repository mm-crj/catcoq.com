I live as a location-independent artist and hop from country to country every few months, building my portfolio as I go.  I run my entire business while on the move, managing all of my creative entrepreneurial work remotely. My “office” changes daily, usually a coffee shop, coworking space, or airport terminal somewhere in the world. My artwork is directly inspired from my travels and I build my art portfolio right along with the list of cultural experiences that infuse my pieces with their signature style. My artwork reflects the unique vibes and surroundings of each place I visit. I illustrate in a variety of mediums, but my two most popular styles are my  watercolor paintings  and  digital illustrations .
